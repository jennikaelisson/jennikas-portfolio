          Hello there! I'm Jennika Elisson, hailing from a small island in the
          northern archipelago of Gothenburg. My professional journey has taken
          me through various industries, but it wasn't until I ventured into the
          IT world that I truly felt at home. Currently, I'm on a two-year Full
          Stack Developer program at Medieinstitutet, where I'm diving deep into
          technologies such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Node, and more.
        <br /><br />
          My academic background includes a three-year degree in Business
          Administration with a focus on marketing and a year studying art and
          design. I've also delved into various digital creation courses and
          expanded my skills in web development and programming.
       <br /><br />
          I thrive on creativity and enjoy the freedom of bringing ideas to
          life. While I'm studying full-stack, my heart leans towards frontend
          development. You can find my diverse projects under the "Portfolio"
          section on my page. Besides coding, I recently transformed a van into
          a fully-equipped camper named Betty Blue, taking her on adventures
          across Europe.
        <br /><br />
          Traveling and continuous learning are my passions, having lived and
          worked in countries like Ireland, Poland, New Zealand, and England.
          I'm excited about the prospect of becoming an excellent full-stack
          developer, contributing to a dynamic team, and maintaining a positive
          team spirit. Feel free to connect with me on{" "}
